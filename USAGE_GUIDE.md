## Your First Trade (Paper Mode)

Paper trading uses fake money so you can practice without risk.

### Step 1: Go to Paper Trading

1. Click on **Paper Trading** in the left sidebar
2. You'll see your virtual cash balance (usually $100,000 to start)

### Step 2: Find a Stock to Buy

**Option A: Use the Watchlist**

1. Go to **Market** page
2. Search for a company you know (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple)
3. Click "Add to Watchlist"
4. View the signals for that stock

**Option B: Use AI Recommendations**

1. Go to **Trading** page
2. Look at the signals list
3. Find a "BUY" signal with high confidence (>70%)

### Step 3: Understanding the Signal

Before buying, check these details:

**Signal Type**:

- 🟢 BUY = AI suggests buying
- 🔴 SELL = AI suggests selling (if you own it)
- 🟡 HOLD = AI suggests keeping what you have

**Confidence**: How sure the AI is (0-100%)

- 90-100%: Very confident
- 70-89%: Confident
- 50-69%: Moderate confidence
- Below 50%: Low confidence (probably skip)

**Target Price**: Price AI expects stock to reach
**Stop Loss**: Safety price - sell if it drops this low

**Example Signal**:

```
AAPL - BUY
Confidence: 85%
Current Price: $175
Target Price: $190
Stop Loss: $165
```

This means:

- Buy Apple stock now at $175
- AI expects it to reach $190
- If it drops to $165, consider selling to limit loss

### Step 4: Place Your Order

1. Click on the signal or stock
2. Click "Trade" or "Buy" button
3. Enter number of shares (start with 1-10)
4. Review your order
5. Click "Confirm"

**Order Types**:

- **Market Order**: Buy immediately at current price (easiest for beginners)
- **Limit Order**: Only buy at a specific price you set (more control)

### Step 5: Monitor Your Trade

1. Go to **Portfolio** page
2. See your new position listed
3. Watch the price over time
4. Check back daily to see how it's doing

### Step 6: When to Sell

Sell when:

- ✅ You reach your target price (profit!)
- ✅ You get a SELL signal with high confidence
- ✅ Price drops to your stop loss (limit loss)
- ⚠️ You need to rebalance your portfolio

**Don't sell based on emotions!** Stick to your plan.
